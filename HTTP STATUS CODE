an HTTP request. 
->They are categorized into five groups, each representing a different type of response.

  i) 1xx (Informational)     : The request was received, and the process is continuing.

 ii) 2xx (Success)           : The request was successful.

iii) 3xx (Redirection)       : The request was redirected to a different URL.

 iv) 4xx (Client Errors)     : Something is wrong with the request from the client (your browser).

  v) 5xx (Server Errors)     : The server failed to process the request.
